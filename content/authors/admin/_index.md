I am an associate researcher at the Lebanese National Center for Remote Sensing - National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS), where I have established the Geospatial Earth Observation (GEO) group. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Communication in 2013 and was with Toyota Motor North America, InfoTech Labs at Mountain View, USA, before joining CNRS in 2015, where I also acted as the coordinator of the Lebanese National Innovation Transfer Network.


I have over 40 publications with unique research focus on **AI-assisted mapping** spanning various applications, including urban analytics, transportation, waterbodies monitoring and crop-yield estimation. In the past, I made research contributions to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicular cognitive networks and IEEE P1609 standard Working Group.
