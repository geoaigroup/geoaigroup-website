I am currently working as an Operations Research Developer at IBS Software, Montreal, Canada.
I have received my Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto in November 2019, under supervision of Prof. Farid N. Najm.
My research topic was in the area of Computer Aided Design (CAD) for integrated circuits (a.k.a EDA). We won the Best Paper Award in ICCAD 2020 for the paper related to my Master's thesis.
I have also received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer and Communications Engineering, as well as a minor in Mathematics, at the American University of Beirut, in May 2017.
