  abstract = "Water scarcity has been well pronounced in the Middle East
              Region; however, Lebanon is still characterized by wet climate
              and sufficient water resources. It is a paradox that Lebanon is
              now under water stress, and many contradictory studies on the
              climate of Lebanon attributed water stress to the changing
              climate. Most of these studies were applied with incomplete
              climatic data records. Therefore, all management approaches were
              implemented after considering climate as a major influencer on
              water resources. In this study, the Emberger Aridity Index (EAi)
              was employed to investigate the climate regime of Lebanon over
              more than 30 years focusing on ten representative meteorological
              stations where comprehensive climatic records were analysed and
              supported by remotely sensed data. The EAi indicates that Lebanon
              is still characterized by humid climate, which conflicts with the
              concept of drought existence. Thus, 47\% of the Lebanese
              territory is characterized by humid to sub-humid climate and 29\%
              by semi-arid climate according to Emberger classification. This
              obviously shows that even the climate impact has a role on water
              scarcity, but it is not the principal influencer. The results of
              this study help applying new approaches for water management
              where the negative human interference should be accounted. It
              guides stakeholder and decision-maker to follow appropriate water
              and agricultural policies and strategies for better sustainable
              development.",
