ABSTRACT = {Natural disasters and wars wreak havoc not only on individuals and critical infrastructure, but also leave behind ruined residential buildings and housings. The size, type and location of damaged houses are essential data sources for the post-disaster reconstruction process. Building damage detection due to war activities has not been thoroughly discussed in the literature. In this paper, an automated building damage detection technique that relies on both pre- and post-war aerial images is proposed. Building damage estimation was done using shadow information and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix features. Accuracy assessment applied over a Syrian war-affected zone near Damascus reveals the excellent performance of the proposed technique.},
