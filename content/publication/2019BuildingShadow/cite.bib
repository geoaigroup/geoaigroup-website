              However, automatically detecting such shadows with the use of
              computer tools is a challenging research problem. In this paper,
              an approach toward successful building shadow detection based on
              multi-threshold image segmentation technique is introduced and
              analyzed. Accuracy assessment and computing time analyses
              conducted over seven study areas from two reference datasets show
              the high performance of our proposed approach in detecting real
              shadows with a 93.75\% accuracy.",
