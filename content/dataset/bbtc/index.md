Beirut Buildings Type Classification (BBTC) dataset is a collection of buildings satellite images from Beirut City where each building is manually annotated as either residential or not.

BBTC dataset can be accessed through this <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/bbtc/bbtc_dataset.tar.gz" target="_blank">GCP bucket</a> where the "Requester Pays" feature is enabled, and thus the requester needs to include a billing project in their requests and will be charged by GCP for their access to the dataset.

For more details on how to access a "Requester Pays" bucket object, you can refer to this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-requester-pays#rest-access-requester-pays" target="_blank"> documentation.</a>
