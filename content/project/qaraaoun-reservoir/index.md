Qaraaoun Reservoir Volume Estimation from Aerial Images is an essential building block to enable scientists and researchers understand the hydrological dynamics of the largest water reservoir in Lebanon. In this project, we combined machine learning techniques and Sentinel-2 imagery to provide the first time-series of water volume of the Qaraaoun reservoir. The provided data dashboard can be accessed via following <a href="http://geoai.cnrs.edu.lb/qaraaoun" target="_blank">link</a> and is being autonomously updated on a daily basis.
